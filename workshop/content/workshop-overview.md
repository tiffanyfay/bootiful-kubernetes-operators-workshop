Kubernetes is designed for automation.
It provides lots of built-in automation out-of-the-box to for example deploy and run workloads, and you can automate how Kubernetes does that.

Kubernetes' **operator pattern** concept lets you **extend the cluster's behavior** without modifying the code of Kubernetes itself. **Operators are clients of the Kubernetes API that act as controllers for a Custom Resource.**

**This interactive workshop aims to teach you how to build extensions for Kubernetes with operators using your most loved application framework Spring Boot.**
